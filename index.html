<h1>All about me!</h1>

<p>
    I'm in my third year here at CSI but I declared my major as Computer Science at the begining of Fall 2024. I'm fairly new to coding and only know c++ from the classes at the college. 
    I definitely am eager to learn more and put myself out there. Heres a few things about me!
